#Points to note:
#1. RUN <command>==>command is run in a shell which is by default "/bin/sh -c" in linux!
#2. The RUN instruction will execute any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results.
#    The resulting committed image will be used for the next step in the Dockerfile.
#    Layering RUN instructions and generating commits conforms to the core concepts
#    of Docker where commits are cheap and containers can be created from any point in an imageâ€™s history, much like source control.
#    No wonder there are intermediate containners created!!
