#naming key in a dot separated way makes it easier to see what property is related!!
#In this way, smart editor, like intellij, would use auto code completion for typing properties!!
#We sometimes underestimate the power of readability,
# yet a convention like this makes it easy for anyone to add, edit or maintain these properties.
# This becomes very important when working in teams or when on-boarding juniors.
